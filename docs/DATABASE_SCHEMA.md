# Database Schema Documentation

**Note**: This file is primarily a placeholder for auto-generated documentation.

For the active `text-to-query` service, the schema information is dynamically fetched from the Cube.js API at runtime (via the `cube_metadata.py` module).

If you are looking for the generated Cube.js schema files, they can be found in the `./cubes` directory after running the `semantic_layer` pipeline.
